This will be a functional website for planning and sharing character builds for the the PC game Pathfinder: Kingmaker.


The goal is to have users be able to sign in and generate characters, planning each level up to see what skills are available and how they impact their character overall before they need commit to a build in game.


Currently working on base character generation: picking your class, race, and starting ability scores and skills. Next up will be creating the level up system and adding all feats/class abilities.


After will be formatting an end Character Sheet with all the information on your character for reference or sharing with others.


Finally I would like to add the ability to equip your character with notable items to give a better feel of character strength when fully equiped.
